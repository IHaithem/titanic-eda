# Titanic EDA Project

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle's "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" competition.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze survival patterns among Titanic passengers using Python. The notebook includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Summary statistics and group-based insights
- Visualizations of survival rates by gender, class, and other features

## 📊 Dataset

- Format: CSV
- Key features: `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Fare`, `Embarked`, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📈 Visualizations

- Bar plots of survival by gender and class
- Heatmaps showing survival probabilities across feature combinations
